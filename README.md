# Jimmy's Arsenal
A personal project of mine, Jimmy's Arsenal is a Terraria mod that aims at diversifying the ranged weapon selection.

Each weapon is designed and fine-tuned in order to maintain balance between modded weapons and vanilla weapons, with
factors such as DPS kept in mind to ensure that no weapon is too overpowered.
